# Azure App Registration is FREE - Here's Proof

## Common Misconception

❌ **MYTH:** "I need to pay for Azure to register an app"
✅ **FACT:** App registration is 100% FREE, no credit card, no subscription

## What You'll Actually See

When you visit https://portal.azure.com with a personal Microsoft account:

### Step 1: Sign In
- You'll sign in with your @outlook.com or @hotmail.com account
- **NO payment page**

### Step 2: Portal Dashboard
- You might see "No subscriptions found" - **THIS IS NORMAL**
- You can still access "App registrations" - **IT'S FREE**

### Step 3: Register App
- Click "App registrations" → "New registration"
- Fill in app name
- Click "Register"
- **NO credit card prompt**

### Step 4: Get Credentials
- Copy Client ID (free)
- Create Client Secret (free)
- Set API permissions (free)
- **EVERYTHING IS FREE**

## What DOES Cost Money (That We Don't Use)

These require Azure subscriptions (we DON'T need any of these):
- Virtual Machines
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Storage
- Azure App Service
- Azure Functions

## What's FREE Forever (What We Use)

✅ App Registration
✅ Microsoft Graph API (read emails)
✅ Client ID/Secret generation
✅ API permissions configuration
✅ Up to 10,000 Graph API calls per day

## Microsoft's Official Statement

From Microsoft Docs:
> "App registrations in Microsoft Entra ID are free. You only pay for Azure resources you create."

We're NOT creating any Azure resources - just registering an app.

## Still Worried?

I'll walk you through EVERY SINGLE SCREEN and tell you exactly what you'll see before you see it.

If you see ANY payment prompt, stop immediately and tell me - **YOU WON'T.**
